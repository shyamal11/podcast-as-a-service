Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host echo-pod and Friday October 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nStripe in talks to acquire Bridge for $1 billion\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nStripe is in talks to acquire stablecoin platform Bridge for a whopping $1 billion, according to Forbes. The talks are reportedly in advanced stages, although nothing has been finalized.\nBridge, co-founded by Coinbase alumni Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, has built an API that helps companies accept stablecoins. The pair raised $58 million from investors like Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, according to PitchBook. If the deal with Stripe goes through, it would be a huge jump from Bridge\u2019s $200 million valuation, as well as being Stripe\u2019s largest acquisition to date.\nStripe has made it clear that crypto is a huge priority for the company. In July, it enabled crypto purchases in the EU, and earlier this month, Stripe announced a Pay with Crypto feature that lets merchants accept stablecoins.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk's X is changing its privacy policy to allow third parties to train AI on your posts\ndescription1:\nOn Wednesday, social network X (formerly Twitter) updated its Privacy Policy to indicate that it would allow third-party \u201ccollaborators\u201d to train their AI models on X data, unless users opt out. While X owner Elon Musk trained xAI\u2019s Grok AI chatbot on X user data, leading to an investigation by the EU\u2019s lead privacy regulator, the company hadn\u2019t yet amended its policy to indicate its data may also be used by third parties.\nThe addition to the policy implies that X, like Reddit and various media organizations, is looking into licensing data to AI companies as a potential new revenue stream.\nIn Section 3 of the updated Privacy Policy titled \u201cSharing Information,\u201d X added a paragraph detailing how X user data can be used and how users could opt out.\nIt reads:\n\u201cThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X\u2019s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\u201d\nThe policy points to the settings page on X, but does not specifically indicate where users would go within the settings to toggle off data-sharing. Currently, the \u201cPrivacy and safety\u201d section in settings lets users turn on or off data-sharing with xAI\u2019s Grok and with other \u201cbusiness partners,\u201d but the latter is described as those companies that X may work with to \u201crun and improve its products,\u201d not other AI providers.\nThat may be because the updated privacy policy won\u2019t become effective until November 15, at which point the opt-out option could be added. (We hope.)\nIn addition, the company removed a paragraph that said it keeps user \u201cprofile information and content for the duration of your account,\u201d and that it keeps other \u201cpersonally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.\u201d\nInstead, the new section explains that X will keep \u201cdifferent types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.\u201d As an example, it notes that usage information like the \u201ccontent you post\u201d and your interactions with others\u2019 content will be kept for \u201cthe duration of your account or until such content is removed.\u201d\nThe policy also added a note reminding users that public content can exist elsewhere even after it\u2019s removed from X. This could potentially cover the data\u2019s ingestion by AI providers, as X adds, \u201csearch engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X.\u201d\nSeparately, X has added a new \u201cLiquidated Damages\u201d section to its updated Terms of Service that says any organization scraping its content will be liable for damages. Specifically, \u201cfor requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts (including reply posts, video posts, image posts, and any other posts) in any 24-hour period,\u201d X says the organization will be charged $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts.\nThe move to monetize X data follows advertiser withdrawals and boycotts and a subscription feature that has yet to take off, which have left the company in need of new ways to pay its bills.\nX did not respond to a request for comment.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Shares closed the day up about 1% at $136.93.\nShares of Nvidia rose to a new record Thursday as investors piled back in to the artificial intelligence trade, which had stalled a bit since the summer. The stock rose more than 3% at one point to briefly tap a new intraday high of $140.89.\nNvidia's intraday record comes after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , the world's largest chip producer, beat third-quarter earnings estimates and posted a 54% increase in profit. The company produces chips for companies such as Apple , Nvidia, AMD and ARM .\nNvidia stock hit a closing high of $138.07 on Monday, topping its prior record of $135.58 set June 18. Shares are up 180% year to date and have increased more than ninefold since the beginning of 2023.\nCompanies including Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in massive quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.\nNvidia recently said demand for its next-generation AI GPU, called Blackwell, is \"insane\" and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.\n\u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle replaces executive in charge of Search and advertising\ndescription3:\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai announced on Thursday that Prabhakar Raghavan, the executive in charge of the company\u2019s search engine and ads products, is leaving his role. Longtime Google executive Nick Fox will replace Raghavan, who will now take on the role of chief technologist.\n\u201cPrabhakar has decided it\u2019s time to make a big leap in his own career,\u201d Pichai said in the announcement. \u201cAfter 12 years leading teams across Google, he\u2019ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d\nRaghavan led the Gmail team in launching Smart Reply and Smart Compose, which were the email service\u2019s first AI products. Since then, Raghavan has overseen the launch of AI Overviews and Circle to Search, along with AI features in Maps and Shopping, such as Immersive View and virtual try-on.\nPichai says Fox has \u201cbeen instrumental in shaping Google\u2019s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar and his leadership team.\u201d\nFox has helped launch products like Google Fi and RCS messaging.\nIn addition to the change in roles, Pichai announced that the Gemini app team led by Sissie Hsiao will join Google DeepMind under Demis Hassabis.\nThe executive writes that bringing the two teams together \u201cwill improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.\u201d\nThe Google Assistant team will also become part of Google\u2019s Platforms and Devices team so they can be closer to the products that they\u2019re building for, Pichai says.\nThe changes announced today come as Google has been working to establish itself as a leader in AI. They also come as the company is facing several antitrust lawsuits.\n\ntitle4:\nAll mobile phones must be hearing aid compatible under new FCC rules\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Thursday issued rules requiring that all mobile phones \u2014 including smartphones \u2014 sold in the U.S. be compatible with hearing aids. The news comes two years after the FDA made hearing aids available to all Americans without a prescription.\nThe FCC has not yet issued a specific timeline for compliance, only noting that the rules will be fully in effect \u201cafter a transition period.\u201d The rules discourage handset makers from instituting proprietary Bluetooth coupling, which could limit device compatibility with over-the-counter hearing aids.\nUnder the new rules, companies will be required to note on their website if a given handset is compatible with hearing aids.\"\n\nResponse:",
